        <h3>A little about me</h3>
        <p>
    	Hello! I am a former Lotus Notes Developer with about 7 years of work experience.  I graduated from Boston University (a while back) with a major in Environmental Policy and minor in Computer Science. 
    	I quit my job to be at home with my family several years ago. 
Did lots of volunteer work at school and community. At this point  
I would like to refresh/update and learn new skills, possibly go back to work.  I am contemplating doing a masters degree in IT.  Trying out a few courses to determine if this is the right path for me to continue in.  
</p>
<p>
	I live in Bethesda, Maryland (in the Washington, DC metro area).  Some of the activities I enjoy are reading, hiking, biking, travelling and dancing.
